// The Monster class has a few different features that all aim to make monsters
// behave as realistically as possible.
//
// - **States:** first of all, the monster has several different states like
// IDLE, ATTACKING, MOVING and DEATH. The monster will randomly move around in
// a certain movement radius and try to attack any players in its aggro range.
// _Note: monsters use NavMeshAgents to move on the NavMesh._
//
// - **Aggro:** To save computations, we let Unity take care of finding players
// in the aggro range by simply adding a AggroArea _(see AggroArea.cs)_ sphere
// to the monster's children in the Hierarchy. We then use the OnTrigger
// functions to find players that are in the aggro area. The monster will always
// move to the nearest aggro player and then attack it as long as the player is
// in the follow radius. If the player happens to walk out of the follow
// radius then the monster will continue to walk to its goal.
//
// - **Respawning:** The monsters have a _respawn_ property that can be set to
// true in order to make the monster respawn after it died. We developed the
// respawn system with simplicity in mind, there are no extra spawner objects
// needed. As soon as a monster dies, it will make itself invisible for a while
// and then go back to the starting position to respawn. This feature allows the
// developer to quickly drag monster Prefabs into the scene and place them
// anywhere, without worrying about spawners and spawn areas.
//
// - **Loot:** Dead monsters can also generate loot, based on the _lootGold_,
// which generates gold between a minimum and a maximum amount.
